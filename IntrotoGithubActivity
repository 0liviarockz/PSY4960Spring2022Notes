What did you learn about GitHub? 
I learned how to navigate the basics of the site, though, I am still somewhat confused by everything. I mainly just need practice. 


What's not clear? 
Most things make sense conceptually, so I feel that with practice I will understand everything better. 
The part that is unclear is if there are certain rules of etiquette when collaborating with others.
