What did you learn about GitHub? 
One thing I learned about in the GitHub introductory course was that it's a streamlined program to collectively work on group projects. It is also a source that provides open research to other git hub users if the files are made public.
What's not clear? 
I'm not the quickest learner when it comes to technology, I don't really have comp sci experience. I thought it was kind of tough to navigate the site. I am still having a bit of trouble creating pull requests as well.
